                <h2>Step 1: Register</h2>
                <p>Sign up using your email and password. You can also enter a referral code if someone invited you.</p>
                <h2>Step 2: Get Your Referral Code</h2>
                <p>Once registered, you'll receive a unique referral code and link on your dashboard. This is your key to earning!</p>
                <h2>Step 3: Share and Earn</h2>
                <p>Share your referral link or code with friends, family, and your network. When they register using your code and pay the activation fee, you earn NGN1,500!</p>
                <h2>Step 4: Track Your Progress</h2>
                <p>Your dashboard shows your total balance and a list of all the users you've successfully referred.</p>
                <h2>Step 5: Withdraw</h2>
                <p>Request a withdrawal once you meet the minimum balance. Your earnings will be sent directly to your account.</p>
